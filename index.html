									<h2 class="major">Hello, my name is Ryan.</h2>
									<p>I am 30 years of age, born in Sydney and currently living in London. In addition to tertiary business studies, I have completed professional training in Product Management. This will be my first undergraduate degree. I have attempted undergraduate studies in the past, however I found difficulty applying myself because I could not directly correlate my study with my real life ambitions. I will talk more about why I have chosen IT. I am a native English speaker who is learning French. In addition to Sydney and London, I have lived in Hobart, Perth and Melbourne. Although London is my first International living destination, it certainly won't be my last. Perhaps next is New York? My passion in life is my startup, this is the project that I will introduce to you. I currently work in an operations management position for a mediatech company, although I have a desire to make a change to Product Management and to return to fintech, the space in which I launched my career. I have an appreciation for architecture and exploration. I am inspired to make a change that reaches all parts of the world and I am always looking to make more of life.

									<h2 class="major">Why technology?</h2>
									<p> I have had an interest in technology and entrepreneurship since the age of 16, if not earlier. It began with my father. He once worked as a technology trainer, and during my childhood, he operated a computer shop. I started my career in finance, and then moved into fintech so that I could more closely align my work with my passion for technology. Over the past two years, I have toyed around with a technology startup idea that would help renters and owners find the right home for their lifestyle. Over the past six months I have decided to do something about it. Although my involvement will most likely not be technical in nature, I want to be conversant in the technology the business will adapt and additionally to strengthen my employment prospects should the business fail. Over the past two years I have worked in technology startup environments and this has given me some insight and ideas that will help to inform how I operate my own business in a similarly fast-changing and uncertain environment. I recently completed an RMIT online course in Product Management and I found the content to be engaging and the LMS easy to use. This experience led me to explore further learning options with the university. I expect to complete my studies with an area of specialisation in an emerging technology, the technical ability to contribute to discussions and projects relating to technology and with demonstrated credibility that will add to my profile as a founder.

									<h2 class="major">My ideal job</h2>
									<p>My ideal job is to be the CEO of my own technology startup. However, I have identified a role that I am interested in exploring as a fall-back if the business is not a success. I have included a link for the position of <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/careers/search-jobs/jobs/consultant-leanservices-14675?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic">Consultant - Lean Services with McKinsey & Company</a>. The position exists within the Digital Operations Group responsible for developing and implementing digital strategies. It appeals to me because I am a strategic thinker and the role operates at a strategic level. For instance, a consultant of this type would be responsible for assisting with the development of business-wide digital agendas, and may include recreating operational models. <br>Requirements of this position include past involvement in large IT programs, experience with modern technologies, analytics, digital solutions and agile methodologies. In addition, the business typically requires a postgraduate degree. For this reason, I may decide to pursue further studies after this course. As far as my professional experience is concerned, I have a background in project management and operational continuous improvement in both financial services and fintech. I am a strategic thinker with analytical capabilities and a strong passion for technology. My plan to position myself for this position is that I will complete this course to a high standard and I will make a list of the required skills and experience for this position against which I will interrogate advertised jobs before applying. I will seek to apply for jobs that will advance me in the direction of these requirements. In addition, I will complete training for specific technical skills using LinkedIn Learning. </p>

										<h2 class="major">My personal profile</h2>
										<p>My MBTI is well known to me, I was sceptical at first, however, after first-read I was quite surprised by the familiarity of the profile. The results of my Myers-Briggs test is INTJ; Introversion Intuition Thinking Judging. This personality type is sometimes labelled “The Architect” and accounts for 1-3% of the population. For my learning style, I am a visual learner and often prefer to consume information in written form so that I have a clear point of reference the flexibility to learn at my own pace. Visualisations are also useful for my learning, especially when they accompany text. In addition to my MBTI and learning style, I completed the Eysenck test which considers extroversion, neuroticism and psychoticism as three key elements of a personality type. I scored 54% extroversion, 25% neuroticism (emotionality) and 55% psychoticism (rebelliousness). What I find interesting of these results is that they would suggest I am more extroverted than not, which is contrary to my MBTI. I deduce that I am either a socially-able introvert, or moderately extroverted and I lean to reason and instinct to make decisions more so than emotion. Certain aspects of my MBTI standout as being especially true. The profile of an INTJ speaks of “architects” as a people “who move through life as though it were a giant chessboard” which certainly speaks to my strategic mindset. These are factors I should take into account when forming in a team.

										<h2 class="major">Overview</h2>
										<p> Nextplace is an online real estate search engine that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to help home owners and renters find their next home. The problem posed is that online real estate search is time consuming due to a lack of personalisation. Consequently, much of the time dedicated to finding a new home is spent performing a process of “manual filtration” of properties that do not meet some requirement, and “manual ranking” of homes based on their relative value. The mission of Nextplace is to automate both of these steps; helping renters and owners find a home that offers the best value for their individual budget and lifestyle.

											<h2 class="major">Motivation</h2>
											<p>Since the ubiquity of online real estate advertising, there have been no significant advancements in how technology is used to the end of helping people find homes. The concept of Nextplace expanded from the writer’s own experience searching for homes online and the apparent inability to narrow results by what was a small list of fairly basic requirements. In a world where consumers increasingly favour personalisation and seek to distil the trivial many down to the relevant few, there exists an opportunity to develop a new generation of online real estate search that is more intimately informed by the unique lifestyle values of the user. </p>

												<h2 class="major">Features</h2>
												<p>Residential real estate advertising consists of one or two dominant players in many markets. For this reason, the barriers to entry to recreate a similar product are prohibitive and the degree of innovation is minimal. The lack of personalisation offered through these services is not due to a lack of relevant data. A more likely explanation is the sheer spread of these data from disparate sources. Nextplace is an aggregator of this data, that will then be used to augment existing property advertising in a way that will offer personalised that has not yet been seen. Nextplace will consist of three key features:<strong> <br><br>1. Personalised filters<br>2. Lifestyle insights<br>3. Integrated services</strong>

												<div class="intro joined">
													<h2 class="major">1. Personalised filters</h2>
													<p> Personalised filters is the first stage in the journey of the user. At this stage, the user will begin with some parameters for their search and then perhaps apply additional filters in order to narrow down the results. These filters will be applied in one of two ways; either through the search engine that interprets user input and applies the resulting filters, or, as the user “reacts” to the properties that exist within their shortlist. The approach of interpreting text input to apply filters in contrast with visual filters is used so that an extensive degree of personalisation can be offered without the same degree of visual clutter, and to establish a rapid feedback loop that will enable missing filters to be easily identified and developed. In addition to specifying requirements, users will have the option to further narrow down their results by reacting to listings. A positive or negative reaction will prompt the user to indicate a reason, and if a relevant filter is available, the user will be given the option to apply this filter to their results.

														<h2 class="major">2. Lifestyle insights</h2>
														<p>Lifestyle insights are different to filters in that they help the user understand the lifestyle value of a home. Consider a user is comparing multiple properties that appear to be more or less comparable. What lifestyle factors might come into play? Lifestyle insights bring to the attention of the user the unique lifestyle qualities of a home. Perhaps one home is on a leafy street and another is a short stroll from the high street; these insights are a window into what life would look like on the other side of their search. In addition to these insights, listings are ranked and scored by personalised lifestyle value which dynamically updates as the user reacts to homes and their preferences are better understood. </p>

															<h2 class="major">3. Integrated services</h2>
															<p> At the final stage of the user journey are integrated services; a marketplace consisting of companies that leverage technology to make the process of moving to and living in a home easier.
New and growing technology-first companies will be able to access a turnkey market that can help them promote or grow their business. Doing business with these providers will be made frictionless for users in ways such as having their contact details auto-filled so that there are less steps to complete their purchase. The strategic direction of this product is to closely integrate products in such a way that they form part of Nextplace and thus create more user engagement and a greater stickiness ratio. The monetisation of Nextplace is outside the scope of this text, however it is important to note that these metrics will be closely linked to revenue.

																	<h2 class="major">Key technologies</h2>
																	<p> A number of technologies will be required to enable Nextplace to perform as intended. For the purpose of this text, we will focus on the emerging technologies that will be leveraged to create a product that is distinct within the competitive landscape — Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

Natural Language Processing will be used to allow Nextplace to function in a way that is similar to an online real estate portal, with the simplicity of a straightforward search engine. This technology will analyse the user input and translate this into a series of search filters that will be visually represented as a series of pills (distinct visual elements) within the user interface.

Machine Learning will bring a degree of sophistication to the search engine that will allow calculated assumptions to be made about users based on their past behaviours, or the past behaviours of other users that share a similar profile. This process is one that is dynamic in nature and continuously improves as more user data is captured. One example of Machine Learning in action is as a user moves through and “reacts” the homes that exist within their shortlist. A positive or negative reaction will prompt the user to provide a reason, and this additional data can then be used to reshuffle the lifestyle rating and ranking of other homes in the shortlist according to this new insight.

																		<h2 class="major">Key skills</h2>
																		<p>The founding team is likely to consist of a software engineer and/or full-stack developer with a background in big data, machine learning or artificial intelligence (the CTO), a key strategist (CEO) and a head of product. User Experience Design and/or User Interface Design may form part of the founding team, or this work may be initially outsourced and later made in-house. The technological architecture of the product is likely to be cloud based and hence no specific hardware will be necessary, however familiarity with cloud services will certainly be an important point to consider.</p>

																			<h2 class="major">Outcome</h2>
																			<P>Success for this project will be measured in terms of key metrics and milestones. The metrics will demonstrate significant growth and positively trending economics. Milestones may include key lessons learned and key hypotheses validated on the journey to an increase in business valuation or perhaps even in the form of an acquisition offer by a competitor. It may be necessary to iterate or pivot based as the market is better understood and therefore it is not out of the question that the problem ultimately solved will look different to the original one. An important milestone will be that a strong customer problem is solved in a way that is very effective.
